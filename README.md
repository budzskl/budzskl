## Hey, I'm Dawid üëã
Thanks for stopping by on my GitHub! I am a CS student at UIC (Class of 2026), and I am passionate about creating reliable solutions and immersive experiences. My interests are in Software Engineering, Game Development, and Quantitative Trading. I've interned at FunnelPot where I worked on AI tools. In my free time, I build games using Godot and develop algorithmic trading strategies using Pine Script. Currently exploring AI integration in game development and working on AutoApply, a tool that streamlines the job application process. Always open to collaborating on innovative projects!
