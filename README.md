Thanks for stopping by on my GitHub! I am a CS student at UIC , and I am passionate about creating reliable solutions and immersive experiences. My interests are in Software Engineering and Game Development. In my free time, I build games using Godot and C++ via Game Jams. Currently building Strato, a personal organization tool for all my projects and task. Also looking into building a C++ game engine for experimentation.
