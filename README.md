**`Software Engineer | Game Dev | CS Student`**

<p>I’m a Computer Science student and passionate Game Developer, specializing in designing, coding, and optimizing interactive experiences. With a focus on game development and software engineering, I build applications that merge technology with creativity—leveraging engines like Godot, Unity, and Unreal, along with languages such as GDScript, C++, and C to craft engaging projects from the ground up.

- I'm **currently learning** AI in game dev, databases, and API integration
- My **current project** is [auto-apply](https://github.com/budzskl/auto-apply), an application meant to automate job applications
