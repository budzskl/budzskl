**`Software Engineer | Game Dev | CS Student`**

<p>I’m a Computer Science student and passionate Game Developer, specializing in designing, coding, and optimizing interactive experiences. With a focus on game development and software engineering, I build applications that merge technology with creativity—leveraging engines like Godot, Unity, and Unreal, along with languages such as GDScript, C++, and C# to craft engaging projects from the ground up.</p>
